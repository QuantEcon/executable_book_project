# Code of Conduct

:::{note}

This is an informal Code of Conduct, and is used as a stand-in best practice until we formally define a CoC and response process for this community.

:::

The Executable Book Project follows a community
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/executablebooks/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Please use that document as the source of truth for interacting with the EBP
community.
