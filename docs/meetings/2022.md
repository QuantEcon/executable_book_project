### Agenda items

- [Matt] Planning to place an emphasis on Bug/Issue reduction for February (perhaps after the refactors for myst-parser, myst-nb) 
  [Issue/Bug Reduction Priorities](https://github.com/executablebooks/meta/issues/649) is an issue on the meta repo to record any issues/bugs you are:
  1. able to work on
  2. really want fixed to move something forward
- [Matt] Organise a session with Chris S on "The architecture of Jupyter Book" to flesh out some of the areas I am not familiar with such as: markdown-it / markdown-it-py etc. to make improvements for developer docs.
    - Can you record this?! (@mmcky -- good idea)
    - Three Common Ways to Extend Sphinx
    - Overview of JupyterBook
- [Steve] Thebe next steps - driven by requirements for hookup to interactive web components
    - refactor to a (Typescript) core, update current js library to use it.
    - library also made available on npm.
    - Issue open for discussion here https://github.com/executablebooks/thebe/issues/536
    - @mmcky If you need beta testers, we would be happy to help test on QuantEcon projects such as: https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html
- [Chris H] Feedback on book theme structure / visuals?
  - Demo: https://sphinx-book-theme--472.org.readthedocs.build/en/472/
  - General agreement that this looks a lot better than the current released version.
- [Chris H] Feedback on carets / toggle buttons
  - Demo: https://readthedocs.org/projects/sphinx-togglebutton/builds/15966583/
  - Chevrons instead of + signs?
  - Widescreen toggles - could we re-use from sphinx-design ?
