# The Executable Books Project

This is the team documentation for the
[ExecutableBooksProject](https://github.com/executablebooks), an international
collaboration to build open source tools that facilitate publishing
computational narratives using the Jupyter ecosystem.

We are the community behind [**Jupyter Book**](https://jupyterbook.org)--an open source project for building beautiful, publication-quality books and documents from computational material--as well as [**MyST Markdown**](https://myst.tools)--a rich and extensible flavor of Markdown meant for technical documentation and publishing.
